1) Remove the natural language newsletter generation. Currently this is conflicting with the advanced settings. We can make the 'advanced settings' the main mechanism for newsletter generation. Use the same fields i.e. time window, sector coverage and geographies. We will be able to make more specific edits like 'more numerical', 'more technical language' in the follow up edit prompts

2) Show longer / untruncated LLM responses in the debug terminal e.g. '└─ Response: { "sections": { "data_centers": { "big_picture": "In January 2026, the U.S. data center ...' is truncated, and we cannot see the full reasoning trace 

3) Make the delete button on each newsletter persistent, so it shows even when not hovering

4) Also include the generation timestamp for each newsletter (make this visible)

5) Update 'Digital Infra Weekly' branding to 'Digital Infra Newsletter'

6) For each article, have the editor also generate a short, punchy LLM title to show the common theme / headline. This should have personality, rather than just a bland summary
